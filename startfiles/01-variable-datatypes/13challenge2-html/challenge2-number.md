# Number Challenge

**Instructions:**

Create a variable called `x` that is a random number between 1 and 100 along with a variable called `y` that is a random number between 1 and 50.

Create a variable for the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of `x` and `y`. Log the output in a string that shows the two numbers of `x` and `y` along with the operator and result.

- You can log the output string directly or put them in separate variables and log them like below.
- You can use string concatenation or template literals for the output.

**Expected Result:**

```JavaScript

```

**Hints:**

1. The `Math.random()` function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1

2. The `Math.floor()` function will round a number down to the nearest integer
