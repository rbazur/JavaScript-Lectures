# Website Development to Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of developing a website from the ground up, leveraging JavaScript and integrating The Movie Database (TMDb) API to create a dynamic and interactive web application. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a website ready to be deployed online that showcases movie information.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A GitHub account and basic Git knowledge
- An account on a deployment platform such as Netlify
- An API key from The Movie Database (TMDb)

## Step 1: Project Initialization

### Create a Project Directory

Initialize a new folder for your project on your computer.

### Initialize a Git Repository

In your project directory, run `git init` to start a new Git repository.

### Initialize a Node.js Project

Execute `npm init -y` to create a new `package.json` file.

## Step 2: Building the Web Application

### HTML

Construct your `index.html` with the necessary HTML structure.

### CSS

Generate a `styles.css` file to add styling and link it within your HTML.

### JavaScript

Create a `script.js` file where you'll write JavaScript to interact with the TMDb API.

## Step 3: API Integration

### Obtain an API Key

Sign up at The Movie Database (TMDb) and obtain your API key.

### Fetch Movie Data

Utilize JavaScript's `fetch` API to retrieve movie data from TMDb.

### Display Movie Information

Show the movie data on your website, creating a dynamic user experience.

## Step 4: Using Git for Version Control

### Track Changes

Add and commit your changes using `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"`.

### Push to GitHub

Create a new GitHub repository and push your code from your local repository.

## Step 5: Deploying Your Website

### Deploy with Netlify

Link your GitHub repository to Netlify to deploy your website.

### Automate Deployment

Configure Netlify to automatically deploy new changes when you push to GitHub.

### View Your Live Website

Netlify provides a URL to access your deployed website.

## Step 6: Testing and Debugging

### Test Functionality

Ensure all aspects of your website are working as intended.

### Ensure Responsiveness

Check that your website is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

### Debug Any Issues

Utilize browser developer tools to identify and fix any problems.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully built and deployed a dynamic website using JavaScript and The Movie Database API. Continue to explore TMDb API for additional features and enhance your website's functionality.
